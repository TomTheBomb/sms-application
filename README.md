# Spoof.im
This was a side project I abandoned due to privacy laws within Australia. It was originally aimed at being an application to prank friends it was created using `CakePHP 2.X` a basic database schema in the repo `sms.sql`. `SMS Global` was also used to trigger any SMS' along with `Cron` to check any sms' sent.

The sender can be essentially spoofed so the recevier may think the SMS is from someone that didn't send it.
